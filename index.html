                <p>
                    My name is Danielle Aranda.  I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 2013, with a degree in Industrial Engineering and in 2020, I decided to become a software developer.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied Industrial Engineering based on my interest in helping people and solving problems.  Each career move since graduation has allowed me the opportunity to work with some amazing people and extremely exciting technologies, and has helped shaped the path I am on today.  I started in the manufacturing industry bringing products from conception to production.  As a green college graduate, Extron Electronics confirmed my ability to learn and adapt.  I accepted each challenge and figured it out.  In my next move, my limits were found with Flex, I saw what I was capable of and also learned the importance of a sustainable work ethic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few years in the manufacturing space, I decided to bring my focus back to process improvement through auditing.  As a Process Analyst with Amazon, I found my love for learning, specifically how people and processes work.  In this role, I soon realized having a hands-on involvement was important and I wanted to actively participate in solving the problems I was seeing.  This led to my last role as a materials manager, where I was able to own my own space and run with my ideas to solve the systems I was working with on a daily basis.  For the first time in my career, I was part of a team that put a heavy focus on career development and creating opportunities for employees to reach their goals.  Unfortunately for them, this exploration brought me to the realization I was missing the passion and excitement my peers had in the career growth opportunities before me, and it seemed another parallel move was in my future.                      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like a perfect storm, this all came together in 2020, and like many, forced the opportunity to step back, and become more inquisitive in my past and my next move.  I focused on the areas of life that energized me, and how I spent my free time.  This all culminated in my decision to pursue a career in software development with the goal of creating software solutions that have a positive impact on healthcare and/or education systems.  I finally accepted I had been moving in a direction that was diverging from my interests and values, and was ready to charge a new path.
