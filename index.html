          <p>
            My name is Danielle Aranda. I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis
            Obispo in 2013 with a degree in Industrial Engineering. In 2020, I
            decided to become a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose a career in industrial engineering because of my interest in
            solving complex problems and improving human factors. Each career
            move since graduation has allowed me the opportunity to work with
            amazing people, take part in extremely exciting technologies, and
            has helped shaped the path I am on today. I started in the
            manufacturing industry with Extron Electronics, bringing products
            from conception to production. As a green college graduate, Extron
            confirmed my ability to learn and adapt. Anxious for a new
            challenge, my limits were found with Flex, where I reached new
            extents of my professional capabilities and also learned the
            importance of a sustainable work ethic.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few years in the manufacturing space, I decided to bring my
            focus back to process improvement through auditing. As a Process
            Analyst with Amazon, I found my love for learning, specifically how
            people and processes work together. In this role, I soon realized
            having a hands-on involvement was important and I wanted to actively
            participate in solving the problems I was observing. This led to my
            most recent role as a materials manager, where I was able to manage
            my own space and run with my ideas to solve the systems I was
            working with on a daily basis. For the first time in my career, I
            was part of a team that put a heavy focus on career development and
            creating opportunities for employees to reach their goals. This
            exploration led to the realization I was missing the passion and
            excitement of my peers, and it seemed another parallel move was in
            my future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a perfect storm, this all came together in mid-2020, and like
            many, provided an ideal opportunity to step back and become more
            inquisitive in my past and future career moves. I placed more value
            on personal well-being and mental growth, and focused on the areas
            of life that energized me and how I spent my free time. This
            culminated in my decision to pursue a career in software development
            with the goal of creating software solutions that have a positive
            impact on healthcare and/or education systems.
