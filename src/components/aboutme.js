          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi my name is Danielle and I am a Certified Software Engineer with a
            background in Industrial Engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            Helping others has always been a core value, and with this
            transition into software development I am excited for the
            opportunity to break into new industries and take part in projects
            that have the potential to impact future generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Iâ€™ve spent seven years in the tech industry focusing primarily on
            manufacturing processes and have continually found myself
            gravitating towards software development. I have always looked up to
            the subject matter experts I worked with and was amazed by the
            knowledge they possessed. In my last role, I had the opportunity to
            partner with one of those experts and found a new sense of
            excitement while taking part in the software development process. I
            enjoyed diving into the logic and the process of translating our
            business needs into code. For the first time, I left this project
            wanting to learn more, and knowing this is where I wanted to take my
            career.
